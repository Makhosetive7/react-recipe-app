# Project Description 

This Food Recipe App was built using ReactJS with the primary motivation of gaining hands-on experience with React concepts and API integration. The app allows users to explore a variety of food recipes, featuring a clean and responsive design that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. The website consists of a few pages that render cards showing meals and ingredients, and when clicked, it navigates to another page displaying instructions for preparing those meals. This app can be helpful in homes during meal preparation.
